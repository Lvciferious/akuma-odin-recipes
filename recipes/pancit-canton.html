            <p><h1>Pancit Canton</h1>

                Pancit Canton is a popular Filipino dish, and one of my favourite dishes growing up!
                It's quick to make, requiring less than ten ingredients. It's also easy yo make a bunch
                at once, so you can bring it for potlucks, parties, and celebtrations, or even just to
                eat during the week.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are two versions of the recipe: vegetarian and seafood. In both versions I use bok choy and green onions in place of snap
                peas and carrots, but feel free to add those in! One more thing: I don't measure, so go with what feels like the right amounts in
                relation to how many noodles you're cooking.

                  <h3>Steps:</h3>

                    <ul>
                        <p>
                        <ol>
                            1. Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.
                        </ol>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <ol>2. While pot is heating up, wash and chop green onions
                            and bok choy. Set aside.</ol>
                            </p>
                        <p>
                        <ol>3. Heat up a large cast iron skillet on medium heat, add butter. Once butter
                            is melted, add in bok choy and cook until bright green and slightly soft.
                            Set cast iron skillet aside, but do not remove the bok choy.
                        </ol>
                            </p>
                        <p>
                        <ol>
                            4. When water is boiling, add in the canton noodles and cook until
                            partially to mostly soft. Drain noodles and wash with cold water for 30 seconds
                            to 1 minute. This is to prevent the noodles from continuing to cook and going soggy.
                        </ol>
                            </p>
                        <p>
                        <ol>5. Seafood version: put shrimp and squid in a skillet and partially with water. Steam
                            until mostly cooked, then drain. Vegetarian version: drizzle canola (or vegetable) oil
                            into a skillet on medium heat. Sear fried tofu cubes until they are properly heated,
                            then remove from heat.</ol>
                            </p>
                        <p>
                        <ol>6. Return bok choy to stove on low to medium heat, then add protein of choice. Add more
                            butter if desired. Stir until ingredients are properly coated, then add minced garlic, cooking for
                            1-2 more minutes.
                        </ol>
                            </p>
                        <p>
                        <ol>7. Turn stove down to simmer, then add canton noodles. Add soy sauce, salt, and pepper to taste.
                            Add a bit more oil if desired.
                        </ol>
                            </p>
                        <p>
                        <ol>
                            8.Remove skillet from heat, add green onions and mix the noodles. Serve hot.
                        </ol>
                        </p>

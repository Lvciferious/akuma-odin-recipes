            <p><h1>Cheesy Kimchi Ramen</h1>
                 One of my favourite quick meal/snack habits I've picked up since moving to South Korea is cheesy kimchi ramen.

                 I love ramen in every form, ever since I was a wee lad. But putting cheese on top was something I never did until
                 recently.

                 It's so easy to make that you can go to any GS-25, 7-11, CU-2, etc., pick up a packet of ramen, a single serving of kimchi,
                 fake cheese slices, and make it right there with the in-store microwave. 5 minutes of prep and "cooking", tops.
                 If you're feeling fancy, you can throw in a sausage or a pre-boiled egged, also conveniently bought in the same
                 location. Instant comfort food!
            </p>
            <p>
                I have the same method every time to make it, because it's so damn easy! The only things I change up on occasion are when I
                add Furikake rice seasoning or chopped green onions on top. I hope you enjoy this super simple recipe! (Yes, I use fake cheese.)

                        <li>2 slices of fake cheese (think Kraft slices)</li>

                  <h3>Steps:</h3>

                    <ul>
                        <p>
                        <ol>
                            1.Put packet of ramen and egg a small or medium pot, and fill pot until ramen is submerged.
                        </ol>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <ol>2. While water is boiling, wash and chop green onions.</ol>
                            </p>
                        <p>
                        <ol>3. When the water reaches a boil, continue cooking on medium-high heat until noodles have reached desired softness.
                            Remove noodles and let egg boil to desired hardness (more time for hard-boiled, less time for soft boiled.)
                        </ol>
                            </p>
                        <p>
                        <ol>
                            4. Wash noodles with cold water for 30 seconds to 1 minute. This is to prevent the noodles from continuing
                            to cook and going soggy.
                        </ol>
                            </p>
                        <p>
                        <ol>5. Remove egg and run under cold water until it is cool enough to peel. To cool it faster,
                            set it aside in ice water to continue cooling.</ol>
                            </p>
                        <p>
                        <ol>6. Place noodles into a bowl and mix in ramen seasoning with kimchi half of the chopped green onion.
                            Place two slices of fake cheese on top and heat in the microwave.
                        </ol>
                            </p>
                        <p>
                        <ol>7. Peel egg and slice in half. Arrange with ramen. Sprinkle remaining chopped green onions on top.
                            Add Furikake seasoning, if desired.
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                </p>
